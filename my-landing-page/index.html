                <p>I'm Rae Schneider and I've cut onboarding times in half, maintained 100% client retention for 2+ years, and built operational systems that scaled healthtech companies from chaos to clarity.</p>
                <p>At Stork Club (fertility benefits platform), I was Head of Revenue &amp; Customer Operations and built the operational backbone that allowed us to scale enterprise clients:</p>
                <ul class="about-highlights">
                    <li>Cut client onboarding time from 75 to 40 days by mapping the full implementation journey, creating project management templates, consolidating materials, and automating handoffs</li>
                    <li>Maintained 100% client retention and 92 NPS for 2+ years while managing enterprise accounts with complex needs</li>
                    <li>Built automated claims workflow that moved surrogacy and adoption claims from manual spreadsheets to a system using Jotform and Airtable - complete with auto-routing, staff notifications, and approval tracking. This workflow became the foundation for the product roadmap.</li>
                    <li>Created real-time KPI dashboards in Tableau tracking the entire revenue cycle from authorization through payor payment - giving leadership visibility into forecasting, customer health, and operational bottlenecks</li>
                    <li>Managed 300+ authorizations and 150+ payor claims per month across 11 enterprise clients, tracking everything from submission to payment</li>
                    <li>Led operational discussions around claims processing as part of insurance integration launches (though I don't lead the technical payor integration work itself)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Before healthtech, I built operational systems across industries:</p>
                <ul class="about-highlights">
                    <li>Implemented ERP systems for retail operations scaling from $1M to $10M ARR</li>
                    <li>Designed and launched national programs at Mitacs serving 10,000+ participants</li>
                    <li>Built PowerApps automation that cut manual workload by 25% across an 80-person team</li>
                </ul>
                <p>I specialize in diagnosing what's broken, building systems that fix it, and documenting everything so it doesn't break again.</p>
                <p class="about-tools"><strong>Tools I work with:</strong> Airtable, Tableau, Zapier, Make, PowerApps, Excel, and AI-assisted workflows</p>
